This shift has begun and will continue. We are exploring eliminating the outer wrapping packaging and soft touch varnish from our products and we are changing from plastic jars to glass jars, and making our packaging (and therefore product size on the shelf) smaller.<br/><br/>All of our paper used for packaging is FSC certified, which means it comes from forests that are responsibly managed, socially beneficial, environmentally conscious, and economically viable.</p>"

The symbol can be recognised as the shape of an opened jar, and will have a number inside; 9M will indicate 9 months, 12M is 12 months, and 36M is 36 months.

However, if you have noticed sensitivity reactions in the past following the use of cosmetic products, you can carry out a test. Simply apply a coin-sized amount of the product (taking it from a tester) to the inside of your forearm and leave it on, ideally for a whole day. If the area becomes red or has any type of reaction, then the product probably contains a raw material that is not tolerated. If there is no reaction, then you can use the product confidently.</p>"

All of our products are especially designed for sensitive skin and should be gentle enough to be tolerated by even the most sensitive skin types since Dr. Barbara Sturm avoids any superfluous and aggressive ingredients that can cause rather than combat inflammation and irritated skin.<br/><br/>However, everyone's skin is unique and skin can negatively react to any ingredient. For example, some people may find they are sensitive to natural ingredients such as essential oils or fruit extracts, and for this reason we display the full product ingredients within the product page of our website to enable customers to make an informed choice before purchase. Even the most 'gentle' ingredients can cause a reaction in certain people's skin so we recommend patch testing a small amount of the product on the inside skin of the wrist area to ascertain its compatibility.</p>"
